
About DepSky:

- First you need to create the accounts at Amazon S3 (http://aws.amazon.com/pt/s3/), RaskSpace (http://www.rackspace.co.uk/), Windows Azure (https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/) and Google Storage (https://developers.google.com/storage/). After create all necessary accounts, you need to fill the access credentials in the 'accounts.properties' file at config folder.
If you only want to use Amazon S3 as your cloud storage provider, you can only create an account at Amazon S3 and use the example file provided (config/accounts_amazon.properties). To do that, copy the content of the 'accounts_amazon.properties' file to the one mentioned before (config/accounts.properties). In this case will be used four diferent Amazon S3 locations to store the data (US_Standard, EU_Ireland, US_West and AP_Tokyo).


- To run DepSky on the command line just run the script DepSky_Run.sh passing 3 arguments: the id of the client; the protocol you want to use DepSky (0 for DepSky-A, 1 for DepSky-CA, 2 for use only erasure codes, and 3 for use only sercret sharing); and the the storage location (0 if you want to use cloud storage to replicate data and 1 if you want to run DepSky with local storage). The main implemented in LocalDepSkySClient.java is just for test. You can change it. 


- If you want to test DepSky storing all data and metadata localy, you need to run first the local server at /src/depskys/clouds/drivers/localStorageService/ServerThread.java. To do this just run the script Run_LocalStorage.sh. This server will receive all requests at ip 127.0.0.1 and port 5555.
